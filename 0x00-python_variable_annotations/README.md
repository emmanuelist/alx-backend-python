# 0x00. Python - Variable Annotations

This project aims to introduce type annotations in Python 3, showcasing their usage and benefits. It covers various concepts such as basic annotations, complex types, and duck typing.

## Table of Contents

1. [Basic Annotations](https://github.com/alx-backend-python/0x00-python_variable_annotations/tree/main/0-add)
   - Add two floats using type annotations.

2. [Basic Annotations - Concatenate Strings](https://github.com/alx-backend-python/0x00-python_variable_annotations/tree/main/1-concat)
   - Concatenate two strings using type annotations.

3. [Basic Annotations - Floor Function](https://github.com/alx-backend-python/0x00-python_variable_annotations/tree/main/2-floor)
   - Implement a floor function that returns the floor of a float using type annotations.

4. [Basic Annotations - To String Function](https://github.com/alx-backend-python/0x00-python_variable_annotations/tree/main/3-to_str)
   - Convert a float to a string using type annotations.

5. [Define Variables](https://github.com/alx-backend-python/0x00-python_variable_annotations/tree/main/4-define_variables)
   - Define and annotate variables with specified values.

6. [Complex Types - List of Floats](https://github.com/alx-backend-python/0x00-python_variable_annotations/tree/main/5-sum_list)
   - Write a function that takes a list of floats and returns their sum using type annotations.

7. [Complex Types - Mixed List](https://github.com/alx-backend-python/0x00-python_variable_annotations/tree/main/6-sum_mixed_list)
   - Write a function that takes a list of integers and floats and returns their sum using type annotations.

8. [Complex Types - String and Int/Float to Tuple](https://github.com/alx-backend-python/0x00-python_variable_annotations/tree/main/7-to_kv)
   - Write a function that takes a string and an int or float and returns a tuple using type annotations.

9. [Complex Types - Functions](https://github.com/alx-backend-python/0x00-python_variable_annotations/tree/main/8-make_multiplier)
   - Write a function that takes a float and returns a function that multiplies a float by the given float using type annotations.

10. [Let's Duck Type an Iterable Object](https://github.com/alx-backend-python/0x00-python_variable_annotations/tree/main/9-element_length)
    - Annotate the parameters and return values of a function that takes an iterable object and returns a list of tuples containing the elements and their lengths.

11. [Duck Typing - First Element of a Sequence](https://github.com/alx-backend-python/0x00-python_variable_annotations/tree/main/100-safe_first_element)
    - Augment the given code with the correct duck-typed annotations.

12. [More Involved Type Annotations](https://github.com/alx-backend-python/0x00-python_variable_annotations/tree/main/101-safely_get_value)
    - Given the parameters and return values, add type annotations to the function.

13. [Type Checking](https://github.com/alx-backend-python/0x00-python_variable_annotations/tree/main/102-type_checking)
    - Use `mypy` to validate the given code and apply any necessary changes.

## Installation

To run the code, you need to have Python 3 installed on your system. You can download it from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Once Python is installed, you can run the code using the following command:

```
python filename.py
```

Replace `filename.py` with the actual name of the Python file you want to run.

## Usage

Each task in the project contains a Python file with the necessary code. You can run each file individually to see the output and verify the functionality of the corresponding task.
